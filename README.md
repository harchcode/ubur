I made this game just for showcasing my skills and also I learned many things while building this game, some of them are:
- Basic maths. I am really proud to say that although it is a simple math, i calculated the formula for absorbing and melting of spheres/circles myself, because i searched google for a long time and found nothing (actually i found 1 or 2, but the absorption is not smooth at all).
- Rust and WebAssembly, and how to integrate with TS projects using Vite.
- WebGL Basics
- Canvas for drawing texts.
- Efficient collision detection using Quad Tree data structure. Although i know the implementation isn't perfect yet (there is a known bug, but it still works, i will fix it in future update :P).
- Basic physics (motion).
- Optimizations.
